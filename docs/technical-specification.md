## 3. Calculation Logic and Formulas

### 3.1 Area Calculations

#### Built-up Area Calculation
```
Built_up_Area = Plot_Area × Utilization_Factor × Number_of_Floors
Where:
- Utilization_Factor = 0.70 (for plots < 1000 sq.ft)
                    = 0.75 (for plots 1000-2000 sq.ft)  
                    = 0.80 (for plots > 2000 sq.ft)
```

#### Carpet Area Calculation
```
Carpet_Area = Built_up_Area × 0.85 (accounting for walls, columns)
```

### 3.2 Structural Calculations

#### Concrete Volume
```
Foundation_Concrete = Built_up_Area × 0.12 m³/sq.m (for shallow foundation)
Column_Concrete = Built_up_Area × 0.04 m³/sq.m × Number_of_Floors
Beam_Concrete = Built_up_Area × 0.03 m³/sq.m × Number_of_Floors  
Slab_Concrete = Built_up_Area × 0.15 m³/sq.m × Number_of_Floors
```

#### Steel Requirement
```
Foundation_Steel = Foundation_Concrete × 80 kg/m³
Column_Steel = Column_Concrete × 160 kg/m³
Beam_Steel = Beam_Concrete × 120 kg/m³
Slab_Steel = Slab_Concrete × 100 kg/m³
```

#### Cement Calculation
```
Cement_Bags = (Concrete_Volume × 7.5 bags/m³) + (Mortar_Volume × 5.5 bags/m³)
Where:
- Concrete uses 1:2:4 ratio (M15) or 1:1.5:3 ratio (M20)
- Mortar uses 1:4 ratio for plastering, 1:6 for brickwork
```

### 3.3 Masonry Calculations

#### Brick Quantity
```
Wall_Area = Perimeter × Average_Height × Number_of_Floors - Door_Window_Area
Brick_Quantity = Wall_Area × 55 bricks/sq.m (for 9" wall)
              = Wall_Area × 28 bricks/sq.m (for 4.5" wall)
```

#### Sand and Aggregate
```
Sand_Volume = Mortar_Volume × 0.75 m³/m³
Aggregate_Volume = Concrete_Volume × 0.60 m³/m³
```

### 3.4 Cost Calculations

#### Material Cost Formula
```
Material_Cost = Σ(Quantity_i × Unit_Rate_i × Quality_Multiplier_i × Location_Factor)
Where:
- Quality_Multiplier: Basic(1.0), Standard(1.4), Premium(1.8), Luxury(2.5)
- Location_Factor: Metro(1.2), Tier-1(1.0), Tier-2(0.9), Rural(0.8)
```

#### Labor Cost Formula  
```
Labor_Cost = Σ(Work_Category_i × Rate_per_sqft_i × Built_up_Area × Skill_Premium)
Major Categories:
- Excavation: ₹15-25/sq.ft
- Concrete work: ₹45-65/sq.ft
- Masonry: ₹35-50/sq.ft  
- Plastering: ₹25-35/sq.ft
- Flooring: ₹30-80/sq.ft (varies by material)
- Electrical: ₹40-60/sq.ft
- Plumbing: ₹35-55/sq.ft
```

#### Total Project Cost
```
Total_Cost = Material_Cost + Labor_Cost + Equipment_Cost + Overhead + Contingency
Where:
- Equipment_Cost = 3-5% of Material + Labor
- Overhead = 8-12% (includes contractor profit, admin costs)
- Contingency = 10-15% (risk buffer)
```

### 3.5 Timeline Calculations

#### Phase Duration Formula
```
Phase_Duration = (Work_Quantity × Standard_Rate) / (Crew_Size × Productivity_Factor)
Where:
- Standard_Rate: Industry benchmarks per activity
- Productivity_Factor: Seasonal/regional adjustments (0.8-1.2)
```

#### Critical Path Phases
1. **Planning & Approvals**: 45-60 days
2. **Excavation & Foundation**: Built_up_Area/50 sq.ft per day
3. **Structural Work**: Built_up_Area/40 sq.ft per day  
4. **Masonry Work**: Built_up_Area/60 sq.ft per day
5. **Roofing**: Built_up_Area/80 sq.ft per day
6. **Electrical & Plumbing**: Parallel execution, 15-20 days
7. **Plastering**: Built_up_Area/100 sq.ft per day
8. **Flooring & Finishing**: Built_up_Area/75 sq.ft per day
