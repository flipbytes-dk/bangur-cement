## OBJECTIVE
 Logic Developement for building digital home construction cost calculator to aid Individual homebuilders (IHBs) in home building journey

## TARGET GROUP: 
Male, 25-45 years, IHBs (Individual Home Builders), Pan India
 
## CONTEXT:
•⁠  ⁠Budgeting is key part of home building journey for IHBs. It helps them plan their construction journey including expenditure and timeline for construction.
•⁠  ⁠IHBs often do rough estimates of expenditure before start of their home building journey basis inputs from friends and family, which often leads to error in later stages. Alternatively, very few IHBs rely on architects and engineers for budgeting and material calculation due to limited access.
•⁠  ⁠Hence, there is a need for providing IHBs with free simplified calculator that caters to IHBs requirements and easily accessible at different stages of construction.
 
## SCOPE OF WORK:
•⁠  ⁠Conceptualization frontend- Input and Output fields for Home Construction Calculator
•⁠  ⁠Backend logic development with assumptions and formulas for calculation basis the set fields (including cost, quantity and timeline calculation)
•⁠  ⁠Dynamic backend fields and logic for admin inputs (to set basis input and output fields)
•⁠  ⁠Testing of calculator once developed for website for correct logic deployment and accuracy
 
## DELIVERABLES:
•⁠  ⁠Technical document with:
    1.⁠ ⁠Conceptualization for all fields- input, output and backend
    2.⁠ ⁠Assumptions
    3.⁠ ⁠Logic with formulas for calculation
•⁠  ⁠Testing of calculator for accuracy and usability
•⁠  ⁠Documentation for future maintenance and updates
 
## NOTE:
•⁠  ⁠Input, output and backend fields to be finalized before starting with logic development

## EXPECTED INPUT FIELDS:
- Plot Area (units could be sq ft/sq mt/sq yards)
- Project Location- City/ District/ State
- No. of Floors
- No. of Rooms
- House Construction Budget Choice- Low, Medium, Luxury

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FIELDS
- Selection of stages of construction:	Dynamic- Customer can select till which stages of construction they want costing for- This will influence other outputs' logic and formulas
- Stages of construction wise expenditure:	To show cost allocation across stages of construction selected (Example- planning and approval, foundation, slab, brickwork and plastering, electric wiring and plumbing, flooring, door and window, paint and finishing)
- Building material wise quantity and cost breakup: To show quantities and cost of key materials basis stages of construction selected (Building material example-cement, sand, aggregate, steel, bricks, windows and door, electricals- wiring and fittings, pluming and sanitary ware, paint, labour charges)
- Timelines break up: Timeline for each stage of construction basis the stages of construction selected by customer
- Total estimated cost: Overall cost and cost per sq ft based on fields
- Graphical representation of data: Pie Charts/ Graphs- open to recommendation
